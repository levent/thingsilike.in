I use it for my <a href=http://www.leventali.com>personal site</a>, with clients and for this blog.</p><p>It’s a great framework for building static sites and not just a blogging platform.</p><p>You push your changes to a gh-pages branch, it magically compiles and your site renders, for free.</p><h3 id=grunt>Grunt</h3><p>Unfortunately, you don’t have access to many of the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-plugins-with-github-pages/">Jekyll plugins available</a>, so things like concatenating, minifying and uglifying stylesheets and javascript files aren’t readily available.</p><p>Jekyll will compile your sass and generate a sitemap but doing much beyond that means you need to generate your site before pushing the files to GitHub.</p><p>This is where the Javascript community have come up with a great set of tools to make this workflow much easier.</p><p>There are a lot of useful plugins for <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> that will do all the hard work for you. Whether it’s the autoprefixer for vendor prefixing css, making your images smaller or linting your javascript.</p><h3 id=yeoman>Yeoman</h3><p>Using one of <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a>’s generators mean you can have an entire app scaffolding setup with everything configured. This can save hours of effort but I advise against this until you understand how Grunt plugins work.</p><p>The <a href=https://github.com/levent/thingsilike.in/blob/master/Gruntfile.js>Gruntfile.js</a> for this started small and I added plugins one by one until it did pretty much everything I saw in <a href=https://github.com/robwierzbowski/generator-jekyllrb>generator-jekyllrb</a>.</p><p><small class=post-meta>Mar 19, 2015</small></p></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-pad"><div class=col-9-12><div class=post-container><h2>I herd cats. <span class=punchline>remotely.</span></h2><p>I have really started to enjoy programming again.</p><p>We have started developing our social music app, which is very exciting.

Before joining Pachube, I nearly convinced myself to become a freelancer. However upon meeting <a href=http://umbrellium.co.uk>Usman</a> and <a href=http://mirobot.io>Ben</a>, the vision for <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xively>Pachube</a> was too compelling for me to pass by.</p><p>Four and a half rollercoaster years later and what a great ride it has been. As lead developer of a small startup team, developing a product through the acquisition and running LogMeIn’s IoT office in London. Moving from heated brainstorming sessions with Usman to heated brainstorming sessions with <a href=https://secure.logmein.com/about/leadership/biographies/michaelsimon.aspx>Michael Simon</a>, it’s amazing how varied the role of bridging people and products can be.</p><p>Every time I go out I am asked…</p><blockquote><p>So what are you up to these days?</p></blockquote><p>I feel busier than ever before though I seem to lack focus on any one particular project.</p><p>Each day generally consists of working on some of the following:</p><ol><li>Finally <em>launching</em> <a href=https://app.agileista.com/about>Agileista</a> (whatever that means)</li><li>Building a social music app (watch this space)</li><li>Becoming proficient in Swift and Xcode</li><li>Ruby Freelancing</li><li>Part-time Agile Coaching</li></ol><p>Let’s see what this list looks like in a year.
