[Daniel Steinberg](https://twitter.com/dimsumthinking) gave an excellent talk at [Swift Summit](https://www.swiftsummit.com) called "(Functional) Programming for Everyone." I don't want to go into his talk but he showed off some of the new features of Playgrounds in Xcode.

From the Xcode 6.3 beta 3 Release Notes.

> **Xcode Playgrounds Enhancements**
>
> Playgrounds have been enhanced with documentation authoring using inline marked-up comments, inline
> playground results, the ability to view and edit resources embedded in playgrounds, and the ability to integrate
> auxiliary source files into Playgrounds. These features enable the creation of rich new experiences in
> playgrounds.

He implemented turtle and thanks to the new features in Xcode this means that kids get instant feedback and thus gratification directly in the window they are playing in.

This reminded me of one event when I was 11 years old that I think has been the only time I have been truly joyful thanks to writing code.
