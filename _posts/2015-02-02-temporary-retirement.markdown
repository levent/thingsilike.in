Since [moving on from LogMeIn](http://betaboston.com/innovation-economy/2014/09/17/shake-up-at-logmeins-xively-division-focused-on-the-internet-of-things/), I believe I am the only member of the team who has not *yet* jumped into a new full-time position. Before joining Pachube, I nearly convinced myself to become a freelancer. However upon meeting [Usman](http://umbrellium.co.uk) and [Ben](http://mirobot.io), the vision for [Pachube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xively) was too compelling for me to pass by.

Four and a half rollercoaster years later and what a great ride it has been. As lead developer of a small startup team, developing a product through the acquisition and running LogMeIn's IoT office in London. Moving from heated brainstorming sessions with Usman to heated brainstorming sessions with [Michael Simon](https://secure.logmein.com/about/leadership/biographies/michaelsimon.aspx), it's amazing how varied the role of bridging people and products can be.

Every time I go out I am asked...

> So what are you up to these days?

I feel busier than ever before though I seem to lack focus on any one particular project.

Each day generally consists of working on some of the following:

1. Finally *launching* [Agileista](https://app.agileista.com/about) (whatever that means)
2. Building a social music app (watch this space)
3. Becoming proficient in Swift and Xcode
4. Ruby Freelancing
5. Part-time Agile Coaching

Let's see what this list looks like in a year. Right now I hope it doesn't change too much.

**UPDATE**: [Agileista is now fully open-source](https://github.com/levent/agileista/)
