I'm not usually one for New Year's resolutions but I have set myself a challenge to try and make something everyday.

Having been wrapped up in the perceived stresses of a *career job* (more on these later) I made excuses for not having time for the things that really matter; time wasted in many ways.

My aim is to take a photo, write a blog post or even write a small app every weekday this year. Let's see how it goes!
